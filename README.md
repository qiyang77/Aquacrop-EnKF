# Aquacrop-EnKF
A crop growth simulation system based on Aquacrop-OS crop model and ensemble Kalman filter.

# Highlights
Assimilating phenological observations without disturbing the simulation clock/timeline.

Source code will be available after the paper "Improving rice growth simulation and yield estimation by assimilating phenological observations sequentially via ensemble Kalman filter" is published.
